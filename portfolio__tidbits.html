																	<p>Dubhacks is the Pacific Northwest's largest collegiate hackathon promoting building solutions
																		for social good. It lasts for 24-hours, and is held at the University of Washington. The majority
																		of students who apply are UW students, but people fly over from many places, like the University of
																		British Columbia. There are three main tracks for projects: the classic track, which gives you freedom
																		to work on whatever you'd like; the data track, which focuses on data analysis and visualization; and the
																		community track, which lets you design solutions for a specific community.

															Prior to arriving at the event, I found a team. It wasn't required, but there's an active
															facebook page and paricipants are encouraged to use it to meet people. I planned to do it with
															one of my friends, a coder and a junior from UW. After making a post about our interests, we
															chatted with several people and joined another group of 2. Both were coders, a senior from UBC
															with Hackathon experience and a freshman from UW. We met up in person to brainstorm ideas before
															the event started in preparation so we could start coding and designing as soon as possible in
															our 24-hours.

															The 4 of us had a lot of similar interests, like mental health awareness, accessibility, and climate
															change. We also wanted to use machine-learning in some aspect of our project, but were unsure of what part.
															After running through many options with all of these, we decided on something like an AI counselor/therapist.
															It could detect how you were feeling through facial expressions and speech, and give reccomendations for
															your behavior to make you feel better.
														</p>
														<p>
															In addition to the 3 tracks, each of which have impressive prizes, there are a large number of sponsors,
															many who give away prizes for specific things as well. This list includes Microsoft, Google, Bloomberg, Blue Origin,
															Amazon, Facebook, and many more. We decided to go after the Microsoft prize, which was for the best use of
															Microsoft Azure. Azure fit our project needs the best and we thought we'd have a pretty good shot
															at winning the prize.

															Based on the project we wanted to create and the community we wanted to serve, I did some
															user research to better understand who specifically would benefit from this product,
															and what specific needs they might have. We decided we didn't want to call our product a
															counselor or therapist because of the implications it could have, so we went for an AI journal
															or mood tracker instead. One of the potential users for this could be someone who struggles
															to write or type. As a looked into mobile impairments like this, and even watched a video of
															someone describing their life with these conditions, I began to understand that for many of these
															people, it was more than just a physical problem. The social anxiety, stress, and fatigue these
															physical conditions create were far less addressed and had no good solutions.
														</br>
														<br>
															As I had more of an idea who our potential users were, I used a mind map to help me organize my thoughts, but
															it was constantly changing as the coders did research into what would be feasible to create
															in just 24-hours with the available data sets online. Then, based on what we agreed upon, I created
															the information architecture for our website. I went over this with our group as well, and after getting
															some feedback, I began to work on wireframes.

															There were a lot of challenges during this project. One of the big ones was the time constraint. We had time
															to prepare for it, so we tried to keep our scope small, but we had our eyes on the prize and wanted to do something
															that would wow the judges. The hardest part about the time constraint was that I had to design before the coding
												 			aspect of the project was finished - in fact, nearly everything was done at the same time. Because of this, the
															design had to keep changing based on what the coders could figure out. I would make sitemaps and wireframes that we
															thought would work, and the the code would change and I'd have to design something new on the fly. Many of these
															changes were also last minute, so the design was rushed and not as finalized as I would've liked it to be.
                            </p>
														<p>
															Another big challenge was being the only designer on the team. I didn't get much feedback for a lot of the designs -
															they sometimes had opinions on how things look, but couldn't tell me why they thought that way or what they think should
															be done differently. It was a very new experience to work with a team of all coders with no design experience, but it really
															opened my eyes and I learned a lot through it.
														</p>
														<p>
															Building and then designing an entire website was also a challenge for me. I have a bit of web development experience,
															but to build an entire one in 24-hours including the logo, themes, images, and functionality was a bit of a struggle.
															The others helped me occasionally when they had the time, but the coding was intense and they were primarily focused on
															that. I had to learn what to prioritize and what to improvise, and how to write and upload code when working on a team.
															It was an incredibly fast-paced but also very educational and rewarding experience, and I plan on participating in future
															hackathons as well.

															After 24-hours of coding, researching, and designing (yes, it really was 24-hours, none of us slept a wink
															that night), here was our final product. We ended up in the top three finalists for best use of Microsoft Azure,
															but didn't win the first place prize. You can visit our github if you want to see more of the code
															behind this project and check out how it works!
